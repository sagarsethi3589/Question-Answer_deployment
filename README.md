The following code tends to solve the problem of Text Generation and it's deployment in Web app. \
Where the jupyter notebook tends to solve the problem of model creation using Large Language Models(LLM's) preferably GPT-2. \
The folder Web_app contains all the necessary code for the deploying of model successfully into Spaces Web app backed up by Streamlit.
The web app can be seen through and tested through this link https://huggingface.co/spaces/SagarSethi3589/Question-Answer_model.
Also a Loom video of it's implementation can also be viewed through this link https://www.loom.com/share/6dcc02ab23c4463e9222a1f53cbb0a85?sid=542c9433-4bc1-4ce0-9acc-f586dd0a7bb9 .
